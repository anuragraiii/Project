# Coca-Cola Landing Page

Creating a simple Coca-Cola landing page using HTML and CSS is an excellent practice for honing your web development skills. Here's a basic example of what the HTML and CSS code could resemble for such a landing page, keeping in mind that this is a simplified version for educational purposes. A genuine Coca-Cola landing page would entail greater complexity and more advanced features.

- **HTML Structure**: Begin by setting up the basic HTML structure, including essential sections like header, main content, and footer.

- **External Stylesheet**: Link an external CSS file (`styles.css`) to define the visual appearance and layout of the page.

- **Navigation**: Incorporate a straightforward navigation menu within the header section, providing links to various parts of the website, such as Home, Products, About Us, and Contact.

- **Hero Section**: Design an engaging hero section with a welcoming message and a call-to-action button, perhaps displaying an enticing image or background that reflects the Coca-Cola brand.

- **Product Showcase**: Create a dedicated section for showcasing Coca-Cola products, incorporating images, product names, and brief descriptions. You can extend this section to feature more products.

- **Footer**: Conclude the page with a footer that typically contains copyright information and other relevant details.

- **CSS Styling**: In the external CSS file (`styles.css`), apply styling to elements throughout the page. Define font styles, colors, layout properties, and visual effects to achieve a cohesive and visually appealing design.

By following this basic structure and applying CSS styling, you can create a simple Coca-Cola landing page as a foundation for further web development exploration and learning. Keep in mind that professional websites often involve more intricate design, interactivity, and functionality.
